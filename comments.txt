Dmitry Belyaev and Fox Experiments
 I had a rat named Rizzo... she died from a brain tumor, too. I'm going to find a corner and cry now, thanks reddit.  Same thing happened to me. The worst part is that I was picking up a dresser from my ex boyfriends house. He watched it happen.  
  
Very awkward. /r/gaming op is very punctual Facebook is that way, I'm not your friend buddy Look up the "farm fox experiment" pretty cool research on the heritability of domestic traits like docility. I work in a children's hospital and about 90% of the girls that come through have something frozen related with them at all times! 
 Your submission was removed as it violates rule I: No pictures with added/superimposed text. The language appears to be Indian or Devanagari, which is the parent language of Indian. Sorry I couldn't help more.  Dear lord- that's not cool. Sounds like a great submission for /r/shitty_car_mods!  &gt;Is there something about being a dude who likes to fuck dudes that makes you a fantastic neighbor?


This provided my ab workout for the day.  Thanks Did this come with an instruction manual or a tutorial?

As a contractor, I also have a lot of income that isnt taxed.  There are tons of very legal ways to "evade" tax on income.  I dont see why you would pick those making the least possible amount of money to say those ones are doing it illegally.   Holmes or homes? It's obvious he loves his daughter. You're a child for using this as a moment to try and be some moral champion. Either be supportive or keep your mouth shut. He posted a picture because he loves his daughter and wants to share it with the community which sadly you are apart of. Assuming he isn't with her the whole time because of one picture is absurd. There is a reason you are downvoted to the bottom brother. :) i assume we'll never know since op for some reason decided to create a throwaway account to post this and then abandoned the thread Sorry, can't hear you over my FREEDOM. /r/TheSouth [Gaudi] (http://i.imgur.com/tQbw37W.jpg) You had a chance to get to the front page, all you needed was one banana.

pretty cool Poses for picture in paper, stung by a bee a few minutes earlier. The thing is that it's the building inspectors job to make sure things are safe and to code. If they failed to do so then they made a mistake and should be reprimanded. Just because the inspector would get in trouble doesn't mean the driver is still not at fault for driving through a railing. They are both at fault. MURICA, har har. Lol!!! I love this!! The Starscream of reddit. Hey, this is my friend's cat and dog. 

/u/Logic007 I remember looking my son's surgeon in the eyes right before they gave him the valium equivalent and took him back to the OR.  I've never been so confident that I was ready to kill another human being.  It honestly kinda scared me. 2 Flash 2 Franks? I feel like I'm getting further away...

Yes, that was the original reason.  By the way, he just died, I found out!  RIP you poor old SOB!

But in later interviews, he played down the religious aspect and made it more of "day of rest" for employees and franchisees.

The WSJ and others are already speculating what will happen now that the Sr. Cathy has died.  Will there be an IPO?  Will some of the kids wan to cash out?  Will they keep it in the family?

If they do an IPO, I suspect the "closed on Sundays" will likely go away, at least in some stores.

To me, it seems unfair that a franchise should be granted for a PUBLIC SPACE like an airport or a thruway rest stop, where the public uses the space on Sundays - and allow the franchise to close on Sunday.

Heck close on Fridays for the Islams, Saturdays for the Jews, and give everyone a three-day weekend! RIP e-brake Can we leave the Bill Murray fanaticism in 2014?

The "merchant" which is Wet Seal, controls all vendors- this is a good issue to watch and see how it turns out. The "merchant", not the "vendor" is under duty to WARN during mass layoffs or closings. I have no doubt since Wet Seal was considered bankrupt a few months ago that they have finagled a way to get out of their obligation. http://i.imgur.com/rxIqTFe.jpg Maybe he's an idiot. Not Kevin. The car is most likely stolen, and he just wants to get away as quick as possible. If he were just running from the police, it'd do no good leaving your car when it'd be traced right back to you. He's got faucets in his faucets, just so he has faucets. That shit couldnt even stop a running fat kid. Its a pretty wicked metaphor too  It's -40 and covered in snow here in Northern Canada.

 p diddy Great news! Thanks for sharing from a dad of 2 girls.  Oh ok cool. I didn't read the book, only saw the movie. So in Canada, if I have Triskaidekaphobia I can legally force all businesses to no longer use the number 13? &gt; For some reason i always find little girls with disney stuff so cute, maybe because my girlfriend was exactly like that when she was really young

 You're making TONS of assumptions there, brother.

All I made were suggestions.

Somebody's gotta be a moral champion around here. Any time poverty, hardship, or crime is mentioned on reddit, everyone instantly relapses into a "hurr durr DAE Detroit is literally the pits of hell on Earth and no one ever comes out alive?!?!" type of status.

I get it.  Detroit isn't what it used to be, and it becomes a scapegoat as a result.  The interesting thing is, there are plenty of places in the country that are just as bad, if not worse.  

Detroit as a whole is probably worse than many places as a whole, but I sure as hell wouldn't feel too safe walking around a lot of places in the US.  I've driven through South Chicago, I've seen East St. Louis, I know people who have lived in Baltimore, and I've *lived* near Andrew Square in South Boston, like 3 blocks away from the projects, and a few more from where a girl got abducted from her front porch, taken to a bunch of ATMs, then killed and dumped in a river.

But yeah, let's keep ripping on Detroit because it's easy. wow ...chill!  The spelling and grammar on this sign makes me cringe.  http://i.imgur.com/ecIBXYR.png Architects and engineers have total liability over code violations.  Inspectors and plan checkers can't oversee everything and if something is missed, it's still the responsibility of the builder to make sure it's code compliant even after construction is complete and the violation is found after plan-check signed off on it. International Building Code Section 406.4.3 requires vehicle barriers not less than 2 feet 9 inches (835 mm) in height to be placed at the ends of drive lanes, and at the end of parking spaces where the vertical distance to the ground or surface directly below is greater than 1 foot. These barriers are required to comply with the loading requirements of Section 1607.8.3 which in turn requires barriers for passenger vehicles to be designed to resist a concentrated load of 6,000 pounds (26.7 kN).

The IBC is a model building code that is generally adopted by local jurisdictions in the United States. I have a lemon tree and an orange tree in my front yard (large ones, each with a drip line of about 10 feet from the trunk). While they produce more than my family can use, they're not nearly enough to feed the countless people who come by and pick them without permission. That said, we have no problem letting people grab some, but all we ask is for a little common courtesy - ask first. What ever happened to manners? Jokes that touch on gender are actually more taboo on reddit than race jokes or jokes about class etc. It's funny to me that we make gender jokes "off limits" for some reason.

You know, people can make jokes about the historical gender roles and the sometimes very real way in which women use sexuality as a leveraging device and NOT be sexist. Crazy, I know. For a moment there I thought I saw a hand coming out of the eggs touching the guys crotch. http://i.imgur.com/twLdao4.jpg Do all people who like riding noisy motorcycles around town like posting recycled content on the Internet?

There is still a random barcode that I didnt ask for and half the design that I did ask for missing.  And a box of latex gloves. awesome find! Technically it's not male nudity. The year is 1585, and the android has taken over. We thought it came in peace, but we were wrong. It brought new technology, and with that came health and prosperity. It showed us what to do, how to build a better world, but the building never stopped. When we refused a request, it became a demand; when we refused a demand, it became a threat. There were few who defied the threat, but they're not around any more. It watches us from its throne, and the orders come down such a long chain of command that I don't even know if the android speaks at all. I'm pretty surprised, I would have imagined them wanting actual gold, silver or something they could directly infuse into their economy. You misspelled pot I was going to ask what it played .... Thanks for telling us. Even though you're just some internet stranger, I'm glad to hear. :) this couln't be more appropiate. LOL My first thought was "Man that's a fake baby, c'mon OP who are you trying to fool" and then I saw the dad's skin and I wasn't sure about anything anymore. You sure you didn't just take the picture yourself? Good Luck!!! Spotted again at the local crossfit.  Oh no, those are evil and anti capitalist. My employer and the republicans said so. There's not much cost in growing the tree, you can get a bunch of seeds for less than 1c each and orange trees are pretty good at managing themselves. The only cost of growing them is the land + shipping them. But most times the shipping is like 90%(that's a guess, it depends. But that's what it was for my family) of the cost of selling them This reminds me of a prank that would get played on my dad and uncle in high school. They both drove [Austin-Healey Sprites](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin-Healey_Sprite#Mark_I) which measured 80"x137"x53" and weighed just over 1400 pounds. The football team would come out into the parking lot, pick them up, and put them sideways end to end in the parking spot, making impossible to get out until someone in one of the adjacent spots left.

Not gonna lie, even though this is an extremely nice gesture i would be really annoyed. Its early in the morning and the snowblower would probably wake me up before my alarm went off, all for snow thay i could easily drive through. That being said, i would still humbly thank the guy and would probably feel pretty good about it after my morning grumpies wore off. When my daughter spent time in the hospital when she still had leukemia it would take about 3-4 trips to empty the room of all her toys and stuff!

Thanks for sharing. There's a lot of building code and engineering that makes modern structures fairly safe even in areas with large earthquakes. They are built to move with the earthquake. A friend of my parents lives there and I was disappointed to discover that the rooms inside have normal geometry :( Sweet! My roommate is actually going to interview for a job there within the next month or so. Any advice for her? That's part of the disclaimer in fine print at the bottom.  I'm not going to disagree with you that rats are a lot of work but changing their bedding 2-4 times a day is pretty excessive. I did it twice per week typically, and having owned many rats not one of them died before the end of their "expected breed/species life span". Down by the river,

Look dude I'm not trying to convince you 9/11 is/was a conspiracy. Yes I did consider that you may have looked into it already which would explain your very closed mindedness.

This is my 2nd attempt to agree to disagree with you so please, I'm no longer interested in this discussion. is that. . . all your eyelashes?

Set the parking brake. Turn your wheel all the way to the left/right, depending on which side of the road you're on. If you have a manual trans, dump the clutch at 3-4k. If you have an auto, put it in 1st/low and floor it.

**BREAKING NEWS MICHAEL JACKSON IS DEAD BIGGEST TRAGEDY OF 2015!!!!!!** Go deeper!! &gt;kinda of So, next time youre crying lets take a picture and post it on the internet. You seem to be a very angry person. You should probably seek some assistance regarding this issue. Your submission was removed as it violates rule VI: Submissions must link directly to a specific image file or to an image hosting website with minimal ads. That's stupid. Then she wouldn't have an excuse to pop a mentos. and commuting polar bears. It *really* depends on the state. For example: In some places Cars cannot have overly dark tint (IIRC unless it's a limo), but "trucks" can (Pickups, SUVs, etc).  I want a cone just like it. Do they come in man sizes? What you are describing is called differential settlement. This happens when the building's foundation is settling unevenly due to a number of different reasons. This results in bending and deflection of the structural frame, and is likely why your door is getting stuck. If it's happening at the rate you described, you might want to get someone to check it out.  Also, the motorist picked the wrong place to hit the gas Got a free used single stage 2 stroke snowblower a few years ago. Had to buy a $2.59 part to get it going. Did 5-6 driveways extra each time we had a big snowfall, various neighbours. Did this for 3 winters. 2 offered gas money, 1 bought me a gift card. One said thanks on FB each time. The others didn't offer a wave, nod or anything. I don't do those ones anymore. Got a blade for my ATV (much more fun now) and just do 1 or 2 extra for the fun of it. Saw some of them watching me out their windows, having fun....and NOT DOING THEIR DRIVEWAY. Did a couple donuts in the street when done and then put it away. If ONE chips in for gas, I'm happy...but at least acknowledging that I saved 1 or 2 hours work from THOSE neighbours who seem to EXPECT it after doing it once. Duh.  Done some hefty jobs clearing snow for people who went south for a vacation. Clean driveway for when they return. Not a word of thanks. Sheesh. Done doing that. Sorry to vent. (I cut the neighbour's grass too, help with repairs etc etc.)  I've been there. I thought it was pretty cool, but I guess everyone has their tastes. You really dont understand reddit do you? Spazz. Everyone let this guy throw a hissy fit because someones getting make believe internet points. Lol. you care about it enough to comment on it.  Nah theoretically both other cars could be the assholes depending on timing. I feel the same way about Elmo. NO! He's too hot for that.  Go get it checked. Ceilings collapsing on you hurt I've been told. And depending where you live snow will add weight. It's likely not serious to that point yet as most homes are over engineered but better now than later.  I think 15-20k for other people making you famous and literally having done nothing requiring effort to achieve that fame, all happening by accident mostly...is ok. If I was 100 I'd hate this, What you wanna exaggerate the point that i should be dead?! is that it?! fuck off! I see she likes Toy Story.  You're welcome. Did you steal someone's spot? We used to do this to a coworker who would steal our spots when we left for lunch. I'm amazed by this thread because I live in AZ and most fruit trees here are purely decorative. The fruit does taste like shit because they were created just to look pretty. You're supposed to look and not touch. I would never pick any fruit growing in someone's yard like that because I assume it's shit.     

I used to work at a motel with a bunch of these trees. Assholes staying there would pick the oranges and we'd find the trash cans full of them after they actually tried to eat one. It frustrated me to no end that people were so greedy and ruined the trees.  Yeah actually. If they did that every delivery it'd net the grower a huge profit over time Mmmm... you get impaled *and* tetanus! 

I'm surprised 'swangas' or whatever they are called are legal- those seem pretty sketchy to me as well.  AHHHH, the old reddit.... Fuck it I'm too lazy.  5 door Mazda 3 hatchback by the look of it.

 thanks for the update. I can only imagine the nervousness/anxiety i would feel if either of my kids were having surgery. just looking at the pic hit home. Rest easy. fast recovery. and yes, fuck all the assholes on here.  Don't. If OP had been on time to school in the past, he might've learned this. yeah, you might not be the most logical one. How come whenever a photographer has used HDR, it's automatically shitty? I agree sometimes HDR looks terrible, but I think it looks cool here. Probably a dagger. Always use a dagger on friends.  You really think someone would do that? Just go on the internet and post dank memes? You'd think the Engineer-of-Record would have done a walk-through. Or maybe the General Contractor. SOMEONE who's worked on a garage before. The stillness and quietness is so beautiful. It's definitely not my favorite time of the year, but I think it's necessary as a peaceful, calming time. I was hoping there was a DS in there somewhere. Catch her some Pokemon while she's stuck in there. I'm jealous yours have lasted so long! My rats really work the averages from 1-3 years on lifespan. 

Though, I did have a hamster than lived 2.5 lives, so, I'm glad you got to have such a long time with your friend! Because you want roaches to crawl into your nose instead??  I was looking for the part that folds out and has spikes to nail the car that gets too close. Then I realised it just hangs there, passively. I can't even smear paint or grease on it for fear of harming pedestrians who must squeeze between the bumpers! Who did you piss off last night? That is every single kid from the 90's ITT: comments about OP's timeline I think you mean Lucifher's. Pet rats? Who gives a shit? Also whoring your own child's pain for internet points is as disgusting as a pet rat. Can't you just have a memory without taking a picture and whoring it to the internet? Kudos to you OP for keeping painting shorts.  I do the same :) How sturdy are tension cables? I feel they'd be stronger than that rail but not strong enough to stop a car? No, I didn't see that. Gotcha, thought OP was in a car. Agree with you, precisely the thoughts after I finished it. Maybe reckless, but not pointless. If you speed you are going to get to your destination faster on average because you will beat some lights that you may not have if you were not speeding. What he was saying is that traffic lights put you into a time period. So if you leave your house in a certain time period say between 7:00 and 7:01 you would likely get to work at the same time because traffic lights will catch you (if you drive the same). Not to be insensitive or anything (I don't have kids so i may not understand but I want to be an OR nurse one day) why did you feel like that? I don't really know why this made me cry. No one deserves to lose their child, especially before they even get to meet them. I hope your first child is very healthy, put all the energy you would have into your second child into your first. Best of wishes to you and your family. Take care of yourself. Godspeed. Gods be with you and your daughter! Quick everyone post a comment with quotations of what you think the guy in the picture is saying! Typical Toyota driver Prevents me from seeing a accident happen on my way to work when riding a bike. Then just throwing my bike at the car accident and posting a picture of it on the internet. My friend in college put a keg the same way into the back of his jeep compass, gently shut trunk, *shatter*. Just barely touched the glass to the edge of the keg :( Keep in mind these are 1997 dollars we're talking about. I think he says, "If you sing that son one more time, I will murder you in your sleep" Terrible for ad money though. Volkswagen? He should have been able to come away with a couple hundred grand with all of those. Probably saved your life Glad she's doing well. This is a hard thing for parent's to handle because you feel so absolutely helpless. Kids have a way of just getting through the shit. 

also I can't understand why people get offended when redditors share pics of people around them. are you so self involved or hold fake internet points in such esteem that you miss the point that you are looking into another humans life from their perspective. thats a pretty amazing thing.  

Best wishes for your little ones recovery. /r/todayilearned

I was once at my grandparents and when leaving my grandpa said your tires look like they are low on air, so I stopped at the gas station and checked, they were fine and was like okkkk man, but it delayed me about 1 min.

When we were driving down the road a car in the oncoming lane last control and swerved about 200 ft in front of us and went over a bank - it is insane to think (and really changed my outlook on defensive driving) that if we hadn't stopped to check the tires she probably would have smashed right into us.

The kind that will keep you warm on the cold moons of Jaglan Beta and make a strag think you are much better prepared than you actually are. It's not, it's sad that we have lost such a great person. Perhaps I missed a comma, maybe the title should have been:"A happy picture to remember D-Day Veteran Bernard Jordan by, who sadly died, at the age of 90."
*sigh* It's a shame you pick up on the grammar, rather than the meaning of post... but then again that's reddit in a nutshell... *sigh* **thank you.** And epic hair!!

tagged as epic hair dude.. Excellent. I haven't seen such a blatant straw-man argument yet today. 

Obviously, I'm arguing that cars should be allowed to drive everywhere, no matter how dangerous. /s

Or maybe I'm just arguing that there doesn't need to be a regulation mandating expensive car barriers for relatively short drops in a very low speed car garage. Similar to the way that there are no regulations mandating car-proof barriers for every sidewalk, every culvert, and every ditch in the world.  Then just get out. You were 2 seconds late for work? Finally somebody else notices!!!! when i started working in a chickenfarm i dropped a stack like that...i allmost got fired the first day... ummm.. they were likely looking for houses to break into. 1400 dollars!

here are some pics of us pretending to be annoyed Why I carry paint thinner everywhere.  Perhaps contact amazon instead of posting a pic of someone's child on the internet? Shit happens I guess. I mean it *looked* like it would fit. Maybe we're both retarded. Do you even bounce, bro? The whoosa? Or if you left home 30 seconds earlier you'd be fine.  Being on time would have been better, unless you were exactly 2 seconds late, but there's absolutely no way you'd know if you were only that far off. Meanwhile my cock is out of control! It can't suck itself and it's been fucking hard all morning.

Okay, we'll settle for this picture on account of wreck. Isn't this a free pass to play bumper cars?  

I wonder what the legality of this is? Can I push their car back against their E-break so I can get out, or do I really need to sit there and wait till the person comes back.

Also to OP- you're a bundle of sticks.
 Reminds of a incident that happened last winter to my mom.  My mom managed to put her car in the ditch.  Some guy comes along in a tracker, pull her out and says I'll tow you home, as your car wont make it.  My mom starts to give him directions (her house was basically around the corner and she was just going to walk home), when he says, "I know where you live, your daughter through the best parties."
 
She had some beer in the fridge in the garage, she offered him a 6-pack and he took a single beer and said more people to tow out.  

 Yes. It's considered too difficult to see to be avoided.

I had never heard that before someone I know accidentally gauged their car on one. I don't know which jurisdictions are the same (I'm in Canada). 

&gt;Thank you for the kind thoughts and wishes from everyone. For the people that were offended by the post, go fuck yourself with a lightning rod **in a heavy thunderstorm**

Its truly sad how far my profession has fallen. I assume nothing. Look at his daughter and his comments. It's clear as day that he loves her. The only one assuming stuff is you. Nice attempt to use my words to try and spin it on me. Immature as predicted. "Excellent..." Had this picture been titled "Little girl with a Frozen suitcase", it wouldn't have hit the front page.

When it's over greater than 5%? My gut reaction to the high five was "WHY?" TIL 2 seconds is considered late for work. It's not. All this dude did was state the exact same thing, and then add "but they're bound to honor it".

And this immediately follows "That's hugely misleading"....

What a dipshit. I don't want to under play the significance of you not being killed but since when is 2 seconds late? (   ) So you didn't have to climb in the passenger door after all.  Arriving 10 minutes early has prevented me from getting cancer, too.  I shudder to think how much cancer I'd have gotten if I was on time. shitty design, sure. but why isn't anyone putting any blame on this fucking idiot driver? blows my mind how careless people can be behind the wheel. I wasn't very interested in going to work today either.  I sympathize with her. Gotta stab the throttle to get the nose up...works on my dirt bike As someone who lives in the south and rarely sees snow, wouldn't this so called "snow blower" be loud as hell?

Because even if your doing me a favor, I'm still gonna cut you for waking me up early on a work day So fucking depressing that this is *exactly* what came to my mind. I need to unplug.

 Avilo is that you? Cars aren't supposed to drive off bridges, but they still have railings. Cars aren't supposed to drive outside of marked lines, but they still pave the road there. Cars aren't supposed to go around corners above the posted speed limit, but they still design the curvature so that you can speed through it. 

If everything was designed expecting people would follow the rules, then we would have a lot of huge problems. Things are designed with the expectation that there are many idiots and many people who ignore the rules. This makes things safer.

[Foo Fighters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLdJQFTnZfA) &gt;This isn't any more dangerous than a sidewalk outside a shop or the shoulder on a residential street and there are no regulations that say you have to have a car-proof railing there.

For one, building regulations aren't covered under the same category as most of the things you mentioned, which could account for part of the reason there is a difference. 

Secondly, it's *far* easier to put a little extra bit of concrete up in a parking garage then it is to put extra concrete up beside *every* sidewalk. If it was relatively simple and cheap, they might have the same regulations for sidewalks - though I'm just speculating at this point, and could be wrong because sidewalks, bridges, etc also have extra conditions to consider that a building like this doesn't, such as traffic flow, emergency vehicle access, handicapped access, and far more that I have no idea about.  I also really liked Max Schneider's and Mike Tompkins's cover of the song! 15-20k is piss poor for 3 years of being featured in advertising. I'm not even being elitist.

And Google says you are obsessed with My Little Pony. No surprise.  Well Frodo is also notorious for fingering butts while taking pics with fans. She's hitting the front while he covers the back. Lays with himself. Loses. What assumptions did I make, specifically?

I dont see how asking you to explain yourself makes me immature. Lets say you cut off 4.5 minutes each commute, that's 9 mins a day and during an average week your saving 45 minutes. If we extrapolate out to a work year you are now at 37.5 hours saved by speeding 10mph faster in one year if you worked 52, 5 day weeks. You generally ill work from 25 years of age until 65 years of age which is 40 years, which brings you to a grand total of 1500 hours saved or 62.5 days of driving.

Kind of makes you think about how much time we waste commuting to our jobs? The capitalist cat must fall, but not on it's legs this time... Cats are less work than a rat. Feed it. Thats pretty much it. Rats need tons of attention. You can leave a cat home alone for days, but you can't for pretty much any other animal. O, man that's cool.

I've been subscribed to /r/pics for over 4 years and now I am very close to unsubbing.

Is there a replacement sub that contains actually interesting pics? Or "We are" 5 minutes tops and i am out of there. just takes some patience. living in chicago i've been boxed in like this. its not a big deal. The internet. Way to go, Timex My little boy just turned 4. We've got 3 dogs, two who are both now 15, and one who is about 8. One of the 15 year olds is a Golden Retriever who was first diagnosed with dysplaysia at 11 months old. When my son was born, I just hoped that she'd live long enough for him to always have at least a fuzzy memory of his beloved Naya. She's the reason he crawled at 5 months old---he HAD to get to her. She's the reason he walked at 9 and a half months old, again, he HAD to get to her. Now she's even older, nobody expected her to make it this far. I carry her up and down the steps each morning and night, but she holds her urine fine and eats fine and keeps her meds down, and she GENUINELY looks forward to seeing all of us every day. My son understands her fragility, and still loves and hugs and pets her every single day---although if he wants to romp he knows it has to be with the 8 year old dog instead.

Now, though, my son uses words like "Die." Not regarding his Naya, but just as part of his lexicon. I know he understands the concept without grasping the nature of the word. Now, though, as I look at the looming knowledge that she's simply not ever going to quit waking up next to me, and that at some point I'm going to HAVE to make the decision for her, I realize that it's going to hurt my son nearly as much as it will hurt me, and that makes it that much worse.

In the end, though, I know it's a valuable lesson for him. I know he can't know the depth of love without knowing the harshness of loss. She's done more than everything she was ever supposed to do as a dog, and I tell her that. I tell her that she's made us all better, and she knows.

I got my wish...and now I have no idea what the hell I'm going to do about it. I've had a few rats in my life. One of them was hiding behind my couch. My dog was laying there, staring at the rat, waiting for it to come out and play. Well, that rat snuck away, went over to my dog's food bowl and stole a single kibble from the bowl. He then ran back toward the couch and ran right over my dog's paws before going back behind the couch to eat his ill-gotten kibble. Funniest thing I've ever seen. &gt;Only an idiot would drive through that.

He's not wrong. There are a few breeders in the US. I'd Google and link it for you but I'm on my phone.  And attack dogs. Just be sure to fence off the dogs so they don't visit the landmines.  I mean, it's not that important anyway, since you'll just learn a bunch of nonsense there I'll have to un-learn you of.

I'm not a violent person but if this man had an accident that resulted in the death of my son, I have never been more ready or at peace with the idea of killing another human being in my life.  If my son is gone, I have nothing to live for, again this is something that probably takes having a kid to realize because I sure as hell didn't think like this before him. your dad was 18 and staff sargeant at that time ??

I find it to be more casual. Because, if that surgeon had messed up in any way that caused death or something that would ruin his kiddo's life or livelihood he would probably have killed him. I'm a mom, I can confirm the need to kill things that hurt your kid. It was worth all that karma... when will these stupid fucking trends die?

A few hundred dollars is a couple of months' disposable income for me, and having to save up just to replace something a family member destroyed without remorse would leave me irate in ways that few things would.

The highway speed limit is 70, but I only go 65. I noticed my gas mileage went from 32-33 average to around 35-36 by going 5mph slower. As I do that drive twice a day, 5 days a week, I decided the extra gas mileage was worth the few extra minutes the drive takes me. Plus, I get to listen to more Loveline. Win win. Nice cliches.

 deeper http://i.imgur.com/ADJTtKT.jpg If I ever have kids, I'll let them skip once or twice without being sick each year when it's one of those times where there's no break coming up and there's not test to study for etc. I'll make a deal with them where they can just be honest and tell me they'd rather stay home and play video games or go the fair or something. During middle school and high school, though, maybe about the same. For some reason I remember middle school being super hard for me. but high school was super easy. So I guess through out, I'd let them have at least 2 skip days.


Sometimes 2 days just isn't enough. especially if you only get saturday to yourself to do what you want and then your parents drag you to church wasting the entire day while Monday looms over your head. Sunday feels worse than Monday because you don't get to enjoy. Saturday is great because you have a buffer day. And Friday is nice because when you leave school, you dont have to worry about tomorrow. i remember going over to my friends house friday night and spending the whole weekend there. It was like an adventure each time. We'd always talk about Sunday felt terrible because we all had to go back to class.

I'd let my kids have a monday off. Hell, if i end up being middle class, I'd even take them to the doctor saying they have a tummy ache so i can get them a doctor's note. but only during elementary. I dont want them to miss out on learning too much. I feel like I could fill in the gaps during the elementary period. Maaan, my non-existent kids don't know how good they have it. No, that was me.

I've been in similar situations and doing stuff like taking pictures and posting them or playing stupid games on your phone or whatever are *extremely* helpful in keeping you from panicking.

 NO problem BUDDY. ANYTHING for my GOOD ole' pal!!  Just saying something is banned will never work. If you *really* wanted to ban "guns" in a city, you'd first have to set up road blocks and customs going in to the city to prevent guns from getting in.

After you've successfully prevented guns from entering the city, you must methodically purge all of the illegal guns that have already gotten in.

I'm not advocating banning guns in any single city, just trying to express how Chicago banning guns is a ridiculous quarter-ass decision and not reflective of any city, state, or country *actually* banning guns. This is magnificent! Thanks for the update, biggysnax.  Can you tell me a bit more about MRIs then? As far as I understand we have a big electro magnet that is cooled by liquid helium.

Butterfly effect.
If you had left for work 2 seconds earlier you could've started World War 3, somehow... A gay guy I knew bought a house and there was a plum tree in the back yard. When he was a child living in New Hampshire (or Vermont?) his mom would buy one small package of four (or five) plums each year, in season and each family member would get one (for the year). When he saw the plum tree he was ecstatic, since he knew he'd get more plums than he'd ever had as a child.

Little did he realize the fecundity of nature. When the season started, he carefully and conscientiously picked each plum as it ripened or fell to the ground. Soon he had more plums than he could eat. So he started canning them and then giving them away.

Eventually even that was too much and he only kept the ones which fell and were unblemished. But I guess he finally got over his plum-deprived childhood.

And being gay probably had nothing to do with it, but your story reminded me of him. I can tell you EXACTLY how it was overlooked. Someone offered the engineer who stamped the designs a nice payoff to look the other way. 

I work regularly with Mechanical and Mining engineers and most of them have told me at least once every few jobs someone offers them a FAT cash payment, or a car, etc to overlook a bunch of usually minor building code violations, etc that will probably not get picked up by inspectors or cause an issue where something goes wrong, but they save a lot of money by not following them. 

All of the ones I have talked to anyway say it is very hard to say no, they often get 6 figure bribes to look the other way, but they all told me the same thing. IF something does happen, your job is finished. BEST CASE you will only loose your credibility and ability to stamp drawings, etc and will need to pick a new line of work, WORST case you kill someone and go to jail, so none of the ones I know at least admitted to me of accepting these bribes but have said they know colleagues who have. 

If you inspect that building I will bet you will find other violations the engineer stamped that shouldn't have, and there will be a mechanical engineer who loses his job over this. 

This is also the reason engineers are paid so much for there stamp they take on A TON of liability and have to be VERY VERY good at reviewing drawings, etc to MAKE DAMN sure nothing is done wrong, because if something is done wrong it is on whoever stamped those designs / drawings.

In both passages in the Gospels where the story of Jesus cursing the fig tree are mentioned, it's immediately after a confrontation with the Jewish religious authorities (Matthew 21, Mark 11).

The point Jesus was making is that the "tree" of Israel had the appearance of fruitfulness (ritualistic devotion) while being entirely barren of anything useful (having a love for God and for people). He then cursed the tree to unfruitfulness--a metaphor that played itself out in the book of Acts as the Jewish people continued to reject Jesus while the non-Jews flocked to the church in droves. This is why I always tell people to leave space between them and the car in front of them.



Some people just can't city. you clearly never went to college. we loaded kegs into any type of vehicle on a weekly basis without issue.  *Sigh...*

Right after I saw this picture I thought to myself, "Im going to have to get my pitch fork out, aren't I?" Sure enough, OPs faggotry knows no bounds.

Pitch forks here! Get your pitch forks here! -----E Would have fallen  [Beep](http://slurmed.com/fanart/javier/180_calculon's-half-evil-bro.gif) Let the witch hunt begin "Nothing drives down property values like a good old fashion gang war" That kind of drop and no airbag ? Well, as long as you keep to your lane in there, you'd be fine. But if living in a building with a garage like this was any indication, the rules are "30mph and wide corners" ...unless they make that a feature of the contract, as this company did. Now ***THAT'S*** funny! /r/pic I'd shop at Target over Walmart every single time... if there was one closer than 30 miles away. Which is a hawk. Woah dude, spoiler alert!

It's pretty nifty so far. i disagree. i find it much easier to control the vehicle using the clutch and the brake. i cannot stand driving an automatic vehicle  Hallorann: I can remember when I was a little boy. My grandmother and I could hold conversations entirely without ever opening our mouths. She called it "shining." And for a long time, I thought it was just the two of us that had the shine to us. Just like you probably thought you was the only one. But there are other folks, though mostly they don't know it, or don't believe it. How long have you been able to do it? Why don't you want to talk about it?

Hallorann: Who said you ain't supposed to?
Danny: Tony.
Hallorann: Who's Tony?
Danny: Tony is a little boy that lives in my mouth. TPS reports  http://i.imgur.com/Di3tA0G.gif how new is the structure?  If it was remodeled/built recently and a shoddy job was done the structure might undergo extensive settling which will cause cracks in the drywall around things like doors.

To continue the analogy,

* **Elsa and Anna &amp;#8594; Luke and Leia**  
Orphaned royal siblings, one of whom has an awesome and barely-realized power.
* **Kristoff &amp;#8594; Han Solo**  
A handsome boyish rogue adventurer, making a living hauling valuable cargo with his nonhuman partner, until he's hired for a dangerous mission to save a princess. Also falls for a princess, takes her to her people and leaves her, then comes back at the last minute to rescue the real hero and help save everybody.
* **Sven &amp;#8594; Chewbacca**  
Makes noises that only his human partner understands, pushes him to do the right thing and ends up with a medal around his neck.
* **Prince Hans &amp;#8594; Darth Vader**  
Starts out as a good guy, but at the critical point his selfishness and willingness to kill are revealed.
* **Grand Pabbie &amp;#8594; Yoda**  
Short, green and wisest of all, but still doesn't realize that the sage advice "fear...leads to suffering" needs a few more useful details.
* **Oaken &amp;#8594; Wuher**, bartender at Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina  
All about the service, but doesn't mind throwing somebody out every now and then.

And of course:

* **Arendelle &amp;#8594; the Republic**
* **The ice palace &amp;#8594; the Death Star**, and
* **Kristoff's sled &amp;#8594; the *Millennium Falcon*.**

There's probably already a website or Youtube video that makes all these observations, but now that I've typed it all in I hate to look. He was a pretty sweet dude. Huge balls of steel too. also literally huge balls. I drove a Chevy Luv, this happened a few times.  Yup, feeling this way for your family or children is powerful. This is why so many young men and boys joined up with various terrorist organizations in the middle east and war torn countries, and why the operation that resulted in Blackhawk Down was met with such fierce resistance, they thought they were fighting for their families.

This reminds me of the song Fallujah, by David Rovics (folk song warning) 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EM12793_0Yw Why couldn't you just put the picture up for what it is? Why did you have to make up a bullshit story? Baby Ruth? I didn't know Reddit was full of so many amazing drivers. Loads of people saying that it's not a problem or isn't too hard etc. Am I looking at the same picture here? At My dad's work in the 80-90's there was a loading dock that sunk into the ground. Every couple of weeks someone would either drive through the chain that stopped you from driving off the ledge the wrong way or get out remove chain and proceed to drive off the edge. Apparently it is was invisible. Thanks for the actual thought out reply. I can see your point.

Reddit is a strange website to choose to post this picture to if that was the goal. 

 It`s been around a lot longer than a month. More like two years. is that vending machine on the right selling cigarettes? Naw it's not Hebrew OP, you posted a repost, and then called yourself out for it? 

is this a new karma-whoring strategy?  i counted 200 i could see.  Looking =/= requiring your pedantic commentary. Something tells me that's not quite how causality works.. I'll dig mine out &amp; see if I have any doubles. Not many footrot fans!
 Not Women. HAAAAAY OOOOOOH That's why if your in a rush to get to work take your time because being late May just save your life.  Damn it, now I want Maid Rite.  I guess I will be driving to Wisconsin this weekend. Snowginas. What? A django reference? How original, that wasn't the first thing I thought of also.

Really adds to the discussion  I upvoted him. You're not the boss of me. How was the driver?, she must of been lucky to come out unscathed from that now that you say it, I recognize it as a common chant you'd hear from the hari krishnas that used to be everywhere. What the heck happened to hari krishnas?  This is also a repost.  You're married to Elijah Wood? Ice ice rabies Just getting them out of the house quicker.  [why so serious?](https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1802436845/image.jpg) By put down you mean with a Hammer right ? And by brain tumor you mean sick of rodent vermin right ?  why did you post it and make it seem like, in the title, that you had taken the picture then?

Just say it's a picture of a car that drove over a railing in a parking garage. We don't need to hear your fucking life story, because we don't give a fuck. not entirely true, you'd be shocked how many stores go empty before getting shipment.. Only reason I know that is because I handle the shipment 2 seconds later, and you could be a multi millionaire. Sue the dipshit who drove off the edge, and the builder of the parking garage for the pedestrian rail instead of slabs or steel guardrails many welcome  
wow If they ever do a sequel to Young Frankenstein, you could try out for the role of Igor. I still miss every single one of the 30+ rats I owned over the last fifteen years, but I will never adopt rats ever again. Saying goodbye to these creatures, who bond with you as much as dogs and cats do, and give you all their love until their very last breath, is just too much for me.  I had a rat when i was in elementary school and i loved it. When i tell people that, they think I'm the weirdest person ever. I'm glad I've finally found my people! Maybe he's still trying to get out. touching but I can't help but think of what led to this photo. 

"come here honey, mommy needs to take your photo to get karma on a website" HAHA - that made me chuckle. Today I learned that my cable provider airs Canadian shows in California. My apologies. I didn't read the wiki, just linked and moved on.
 I hope the lady that did this is ok. F If you switch it out for a 4x4 it becomes the McGangrape... You think too much, man. Happy to hear that everything went alright. Good luck and take care of that little angel! :) What if the front car parked first, followed by the second and third?  The guy would be unfairly towed.

Really no way to tell the at fault party here. Yeah, but his eyes melted shut, which is pretty unfortunate. Not sure the proper bar was installed. he looks a lot like [Howard](http://imgur.com/naCHFGM), who i'm babysitting right now. sorry for your loss. Surely you realize how cynical you are.. cmon.  The red cap is even funnier. I think you overestimate the average driver.  I want to get a rat or ferret so bad but the SO is like "I don't like rodents, they're gross." She just doesn't understand. :( A coffee shop that routinely fucks up anything more complicated than black coffee.

So I get that you would think that, especially since I subscribe, but kids will be kids, and there is endless material to complain about bad parents out there. This though? This should be on Facebook. I'm assuming that if OP uses Facebook he will find a *lot* more people on there that really care and are willing to relate to the joy he is feeling just by knowing him and his wife. Ugh, /r/Pics has such a problem with this Facebook shit. F Glad she is out of surgery. Best of luck dad. Unfortunately both my husband and I have full-time day jobs... so off to school my baby girl went!  You're killing me. Now I know what to listen to next time I need to bawl my eyes out. What kind of retard doest put at least a metal rail there.... Tibetan Buddhism They tend to migrate where the oil is.  I am entirely on your side. To show off his ink. Or Chad. Please, let's call him Chad.  I think it is, because the car was actually free falling.  Gold for me though. [For the uninitiated, they're freaky sounding little shits.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6NuhlibHsM) having kids is great, if you want you can put lots of thought into it.


The problem with skipping a day of school is the child now knows this is a possibility and will want more. Now you have to go to work, get your tooth fixed, I don't know but you have something important todo and your kid has decided they are not going to go to school today - today is the one day a year they want off.  


Not so hot now are you daddy?


I think its worth it, my dad skipped a day school with me to take me to a F1 friday practice/qualifying at silverstone when I was 7 - best 'school day' ever.
 Topkeg. Why to hijack this whole thread dickhole.  Seriously, take your political shit to a political sub.  You are the equivalent of a "GOD HATES FAGS" funeral protester.   You just made this thread for me. 11/10 with rice and rice comment  You're 100% right. What if Gotham needs you to be a dirty, dirty whore? Thanks :) Or maybe the parking garage is where OP works. He was arriving to work two seconds behind schedule to find that a car had fallen exactly where he would have been had he been on time. There are two types of people in this world. Those who extrapolate data and ......................



I think we know which one you are! Sounds like he has a rat which is prone to a specific condition.  Thank you NSW in Australia actually, though they just changed the law this year unfortunately. :( 

You might try posting ads on Craigslist in the area near you as well as areas maybe even more rural that you are willing to drive to if one pops up. Not to say you should lie or anything, but in my experience you'll have more luck if you come across as a place that rescues animals instead of just an individual who wants a pet. You mainly want to post ads during spring to early summer as that's around when new kits are born and are likely to turn up. The younger you get them, the more likely they are to be easily domesticated, with the most friendly of them that I have seen were found before their eyes opened. They'll usually also need to see a vet if they are rescued and have sustained injuries or whatever, and desexing is usually required in places that allow you to have them. I think it mellows them out a bit anyways. O, also, foxes generally stink. Not the fox itself, but fox urine specifically. It's very very pungent. That's why you don't make the decision to let a lobster pinch your nipples.  No, that's his cousin Jebediah. Wudda falled. You're either 10 minutes early or you're late. Not in the / a Union!

Too bad you just had to try and clock in on the hour.....

Just a little snarky.. It's droppings are slightly more dangerous than other birds' droppings. Upvoted because funny sign? Woah. Its like hes in space... She didn't ragdoll. Just use a [defib](http://left4dead.wikia.com/wiki/Healing_items#Defibrillator) and you're good to go. unless he is implying he was  two seconds late to work? and being exactly on time would have crushed him. haha, ya this title sucks [These are the kind of ads they do.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yb7x8BpCP-4) 4-1/2 minutes is 20%!  Would you like a 20% raise?  Would you like a 20% bigger dick (that's from 5" to 6")?  Would you like 20% off you cable, electric, &amp; water bills, your mortgage?  That's about $200-$500 per month, free money.  Do you plan to live to 65, or maybe go 20% longer, and live to 78? 

Don't knock 20% anything.  Nine minutes a day, is almost 40 hours or a whole free week each year. 

 Is this in Hilliard,OH? Haha so you're calling me an idiot? I'll fucking tie you up and take a shit in your ass, you whore! Drama queen.  2 seconds?  Don't park so close next time.... or say you paralleled and reap the karma You are a lying little cunt. This is not your picture. You know times are tough when even the dog has to pick up a part time job.  Yeah, the store I deliver too is saying that they are staying open.. after doing research I told her to go find a new job. Its gonna close Down voted cause you mispelled "phallic"....haha Still hot tho. shes ill


Or just too much Christmas new year fun? I call it a children Christmas hangover I think he knew. They always know. I don't even want to hear it, UK. Of course it's easy if you drive [this.] (http://imgur.com/RDuEzLr) You have to have some combination of mirrors that allows you to use 2 functional mirrors, be it 2 sides or a side and a rear view. Sounds like your buddy was driving with only 1 functional mirror, hence ticket.

(Although if he's in Texas he can argue the ticket on the grounds that the LEO is not trained to evaluate vehicle safety. That's why Texas and other states have safety inspection stickers; trained professionals evaluate the safety of the vehicle and indicate that you pass with the sticker. Might not hold up after the judge requests an updated inspection, but the ADA generally does not care enough to go through that trouble.) I like how it's clearly a piece of aloe vera. So, if you had left home two seconds earlier, you know with certainty that you would have hit all the same lights and equally fast/slow traffic conditions, and then entered the parking garage at just the right second?


NO, you don't.  Don't look so deeply into situations like this.  Just enjoy your life.  


BTW, I'm guessing that car didn't fall 2 seconds before/after you entered the level.  I'm pretty sure you conjured up that little tidbit just for dramatic effect. Other than all that, nice post, though.  I live in the FCPS school system. Getting to school this morning was an absolute nightmare! It took my bus nearly 2 hours to get through all the traffic on the roads, not to mention all the ice, snow, and car wrecks along the way.  He's a liar but at least we actually have GTIs, tornado red MKVI checking in.  Weeeeeeeeeee! Tomatoes.. tomatoes Jesus....I shouldn't be laughing....so wrong... Shit, I didn't even realize it said meow until 4 hours later after I saw it again. I think he's got something else in there, instead of or in addition to latex gloves.  Cause Jesus he knows me, and he knows I'm right. Giving my last gold credit because killing your own 7yo kid for reddit karma is awesome. Do you have a compulsion to point out the obvious? Mog commando day is freaky Friday ;-) why is the guy on the left taking off his pants? For a second I thought I was in /r/Murica.  I'm being very serious here: Do that. Figure out who to contact and contact them.

I lived in a building that collapsed about a year after I moved out. Previous tenants had, apparently, noticed structural issues. I didn't know that until I saw them quoted in the news story about it falling. I bet the people who lived there at the time it fell didn't know that, either. The story gave me the impression that, had the proper authorities known, the collapse might not have happened.

Maybe it goes nowhere, but maybe the city forces the fix that prevents a whole lot of hurt to you or the next tenant. It's Mitt Romney! My cog neuro professor told me I could get one of these; I thought he just patronizing me.  *over.

If you trip *on* your dog he's probably some illegal drug. Yummy! Piss off op you're pathetic  I guess Toyotas are still having those acceleration issues Wanna bet? Kangaroos are pretty amazing and cute creatures, but also delicious and a pest unfortunately which is a bad combination.  "Offensive lasers activated. Commence protestor nullification protocol in 5...4...3...2..." OP, how did you get to work with the car blocking the way? AHHHHHHH, Fucking 4 minutes late. 


GG.

 But isn't everything on the internet...just comments? You could just smash the window of the rear car and disengage the e brake, there you go you are free beautiful GTI. Easy to play but quite difficult to sound good.
