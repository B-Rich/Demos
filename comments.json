But I'm going to wait for a few generations of domestication to happen before thinking about owning one."},{"body": "The value of the labour is in part determined by the labourers. If, collectively, the labourers make a bargain with the employer, than what they ask is what they are valued, (both the labourers and employer have agreed that). In this case, the employer did not fulfil what it agreed the value of the employees were, even minus a union forming collective bargaining among employees.  \n\nAs has been demonstrated by many industries in the states with busted unions and with falling skill standards, union wages were an accurate valuation because dropping below them caused a disintegrating service quality; Like items being sold to walmart below normal cost, necessitating, due to a form on monopsony by volume, a drop in quality to recoup cost &amp; profit. (A comparison not made for analogical accuracy, it actually covers a different phenomenon, but for explanation through a related concept)\n\n(Note that I'm assuming the relevant dominant management paradigm in the US is competitive labour. A fairly safe bet, yes?)\n\n\nUnions aren't comparable to monopoly or monopsony, (anticipating your next point), because the scale of the good/service is different between employees and other things bought by a company. \"Que?\" With other goods and services, we don't expect the level of ownership by the company of the companies it buys from and contracts from. But,  . . . I tried writing several things here, but it's much better just to look at examples in this thread to see how much ownership people think companies have/should have over people. \n\nAnother way of showing this on the societal scale is the amount of bargaining power that people have with employers. Only with unions do employees have the same bargaining power with a company as the company who sells sugar to a restaurant has. To use an example in simple words &amp; concepts: The amount and scale of wage theft is much higher than the amount and scale of unpaid invoices. \n\nUnions, again by definition, cannot have too much power because they are ultimately dependant on the job. A decision of a union to price their labour higher than can be sustained is a decision that the job is not worth the money. Assuming a rational &amp; honest employer, they would agree to that price of labour. In that case, the value of the job has not been determined because no agreement was reached. Again, the value of something is determined by a transaction between equal parties. \n\n\"What about jobs that have been scared away by unions?\", well, what about companies scared away by the cost of goods? We don't see companies or people saying that companies were scared away by the costs associated with logistics &amp; suppliers, even though this is a very common reason, for companies to fail to start up, to move away, or to shut down, (actually more common than unions, especially in the US these days with very few unions remaining to upset anything at all). We, society, accept it as a cost of doing business to fairly pay suppliers and logistics at the profit margin they demand, (or to be precise, a cost dependant on the marginal cost), but we don't accept workers with the same bargaining power as a cost of doing business. This is an issue of social normalization, not of economics. (Which is in large part due to anti-union propaganda that the US has been blasting out for about a century, related to the industrial-gov't ties leading upto and during WWI, and greatly boosted by the same thing leading upto and during WWII. For example, many of the propaganda posters we examine today from those periods can be held as examples of works telling people to accept lower wages, increased workloads, and decreased work quality, (safety &amp; etc.) 'for the good of the country', (ex: Rosie the riveter). That many of these messages have prevailed since without the reason of nationalism would be the particular mechanisms I would point to, to examine the current state of collective bargaining in the US relative to other countries)\n\n\nTL;DR: It's a tenet of capitalism that the value of something is what equal parties buying and selling that item agree upon. (This is literally how a stock market determines the value of a stock: the overlap of buy-prices and sell-prices thus resulting in transactions). Union wages, by necessity, are wages agreed on by the company and the employees, and therefore by definition are exactly the correct value. By virtue of being the definer of the value. There is an argument to be made that non-collective bargaining also fulfils a value-defining place, however that argument is shown to be false by a number of reasons &amp; evidence, such as examining the bargaining power demonstrated through theft between parties, indicating that the bargaining power of the parties is not on equal terms, so it is not a bargain made between equal parties. \n\n\nSTL;DR: Actually, yes it is a tenet of capitalism that the value of something is determined by the transaction between equal parties.

There is a growing division between the two main parties and their supporters - probably the biggest divergence since the pre-Blair years. Meanwhile, smaller parties with specific agendas and grievances (e.g. UKIP) appear to be gaining wider support. The Conservative-led government is seeking re-election on the grounds that they will continue to tackle the budget deficit. Their main targets have been welfare spending (especially unemployment benefits) and public sector pensions. They argue that cutting welfare spending is the key to a strong economy. So, padding the \"welfare\" section on these forms would seem to be in their interests.\n\nWhere it gets more conspiracy-theory-esque is when you ask why they chose not to put state pensions into welfare as well. Please bear in mind, I don't necessarily believe any of the following ideas that have been touted:\n\n* Including state pensions in the same category as unemployment benefits would piss off the voter-heavy 55+ demographic.\n* State pensions are seen as a \"good\" expense by the majority of the UK, so making the size of this chunk apparent is in the interest of the sitting government.\n* The government wants to reduce public sector pensions further and so presenting them as \"welfare\" fits in with their wider message to the electorate.\n\nOnly the people who drafted the document know for sure why they made these decisions. They may have genuinely felt they were adding clarity. But I think its right for people to question what the motive of the government is in presenting the information in this way.\n\n(EDIT: Changed 65+ to 55+)"},{"body": "/r/photoshopbattles would love this picture"},{"body": "I got the [reference](https://wademack.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/dressup_owl.jpg)"},{"body": "And OP is parenting like a 21st century revolutionary. \"That guy is rebelling!

That defect was sure to be changed the first time a car drove off the slab and crashed to the floor below which means that this is the first time this has happened which means the parking structure is new because lots of people suck at driving and it probably wouldn't be very long before that happened.\n\nDon't go through life assuming the worst will always inevitably happen (**lots of people suck at driving and it probably wouldn't be very long before that happened**). That's a terrible way to come to a conclusion like this. Would they go into a murder case \"lots of people kill, so it wouldn't be very long before our suspect killed his victim\"?\n\nFurthermore, you're literally seeing **1** area, 1 *very* small area of what could be a huge parking garage.\n\nNot outright saying you're wrong, could be right for all I know, but you're really just guessing here."},{"body": "OP IS A PHONY!\n\n"},{"body": "I already have to use both hands when I piss.\n"},{"body": "None of those things guarantee that the building is new.
